### week2.rmd
This rmd file shows the expected number of points for each team to score in week
2 of NFL vs the number of plays expected for each team. For fantasy football
purposes, you want to have players that are in high scoring teams + teams that 
run high number of plays so that your players get the most amount of chances to
touch the ball. Results are shown in a scatterplot with the points being the
team logo.

Ideally this rmd file will include predictions for each week of the nfl season.
As the season goes on the expected number of plays will become more reflective
of the actual number of plays run by each team. This is because the data is 
taking historical data from the season and averaging the numbers.
